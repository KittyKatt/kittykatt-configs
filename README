===============

Description
---------------------

These are my configurations and dotfiles from various machines that I run. I will attempt to keep
this as up to date as possible with my current configurations. The machines are as follows:

<b>mielikki</b>	- Desktop computer and main machine. Running Arch Linux.
<b>asmodeus</b>	- Laptop. SolusOS install.
<b>mystra</b>	- Laptop Arch Linux install.
<b>lloth</b>	- Server. Arch Linux install.

Most of these configurations were created by me. Usually, if I pull them from elsewhere or steal
configs from someone else, I'll mention it in said configuration file.
